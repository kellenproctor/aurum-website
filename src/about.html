                <p>
                    We’re a small marketing company. While we have experience working with large
                    brands, our happy place is working with entrepreneurs and other small businesses to
                    help make their dreams a reality. Working backwards from your business goals, we
                    execute on everything from targeted, scrappy social strategies to aggressive,
                    multi-platform approaches to scale. We’re your partners in this, so you’ll hear from us
                    often and be fully in the loop on exactly what’s happening in your account.

                <div class="role">Principle Marketer</div>
                <p>
                    Austin is the principal marketer at Aurum as well as the
                    primary account manager. He’s worked both in-house for
                    large brands but prefers one-on-one partnerships with
                    small business owners because he loves collaborating
                    with people on their passion projects. Austin is currently
                    perfecting his homemade vermouth recipe and dreams
                    of one day opening his own tapas and vermouth bar.

                <div class="role">Designer &amp; Creative Producer</div>
                <p>
                    Kim supports Aurum’s accounts as a hands-on designer
                    and manager of all things creative. With experience in
                    both a big tech company and scrappy start-ups, she
                    drives creative teams and strategic plans forward but also
                    likes getting her hands dirty in Illustrator and Sketch.
                    Kim’s living her best life when she’s reading a good book
                    at a coffee shop and will be a regular at Austin’s tapas bar.
